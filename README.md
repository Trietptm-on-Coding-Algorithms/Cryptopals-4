# Cryptopals
Matasano crypto challenges (http://cryptopals.com/) implemented mostly in C.

## Introduction ##

This is a serie of 56 technical challenges around software programming and cryptography made by some people at Matasano. Every solution can be built either on Windows or on Linux (Mint and Arch tested). 

The tools folder contains implementations of several standard cryptographic protocols and utilities : do not use them in production.

## Requirements ##

* You need to have access to the `gcc` toochain and basic shell commands (`make`, `cd`, `sed`, `awk`, etc.). On Windows, every challenge has been tested against the `mingw32` compiler.
* Some challenges use pythons scripts : everything has been written for Python 3xx. Older versions may or may not work.
* `pip` requirements :
  * On Linux, install `pip3` : `sudo (apt-get install | yum install |  pacman -S)  python3-pip` to prevent name clashing with the system-wide pip binary.
  * `bottle` web framework  for challenges 31 & 32
  * `tkinter` for challenge 20
* `libcurl` : challenge 31 & 32 use libcurl to make requests to a remote webpage.
  * Libcurl isn't installed by default on Windows, so you will need to download the static library compatible with your compiler (or build it yourself) and placing it in the corresponding's lib folder. Download page : http://curl.haxx.se/download.html
  * On Unix systems, you can either use libcurl statically of dynamically (modify the `Makefile` to your needs). Don't forget to add the installed lib folder (something like `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` ) in the `LDFLAGS`.
  

## Usage ##

The `Makefile` located in the root folder contains every useful commands, while `global.mk` has every project-wide variables.

Ex :

* `make 01 all`  will build all the targets in first challenge.
* `make tools`   will build all the necessary libraries and bins in the tools folder.
* `make exos clean`  will run `make clean` on every challenges.
* `make exos compile`  will run `make compile` on every challenges, building the binary.
* `make exos solve`  will run `make solve` on every challenges, building the binary and running it.
* `make 01 07 09 solve`  will run `make solve` on challenge 01, 07 and 09.


Caveat : challenge `#31 & #32` can't be called from the top-level Makefile since you need to fire up a websever. To test the challenge , you need to type :

  - cd `"[$ex]_..."`
  - `make webserver` on one terminal
  - `make solve` on an another terminal
